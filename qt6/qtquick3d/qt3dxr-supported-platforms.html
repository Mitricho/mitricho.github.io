<div class="descr" id="details">
<span id="supported-platforms"></span><p>This page outlines the supported platforms and devices for which <a href="qtquick3d-qmlmodule.html" translate="no">QtQuick3D</a>.Xr is tested and supported.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b><a href="qtquick3d-qmlmodule.html" translate="no">QtQuick3D</a>.Xr is still under development, and all features might not be available on all platforms.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="basic-xr-platform-concepts">Basic XR Platform Concepts</h2>
<p><a href="qtquick3d-qmlmodule.html" translate="no">QtQuick3D</a>.Xr supports two main platforms: devices that use OpenXR as the API for developing applications and devices that use Apple's visionOS.</p>
<h3 id="openxr">OpenXR</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> is an open standard providing a common set of APIs for developing XR applications. Implementations of OpenXR are available for various platforms, such as Android or Windows.</p>
<p>Some VR/AR devices are a complete application deployment and runtime platform on their own. For example, the <a href="https://www.meta.com/no/en/quest/quest-3/">Meta Quest 3</a> is a complete, independent Android-based device. From the application developer's point of view, the workflow is very similar to developing for Android mobile phones and tablets. Such devices and their software platform are sometimes referred to as <code translate="no">Standalone VR</code>.</p>
<p>Other headsets may not provide a full application deployment and runtime platform but rather are used in combination with a computer, typically running Windows or Linux, from where the application-rendered content is streamed to the headset, either via a wired or wireless connection. This setup is sometimes referred to as <code translate="no">PCVR</code>. The applications, in this case, are developed and deployed as regular desktop Windows or Linux applications. However, instead of opening on-screen windows and showing content there, as typical desktop applications would do, they render into offscreen buffers via OpenXR and a 3D API such as Direct 3D or Vulkan. The resulting content is streamed to the headset for displaying; the actual streaming and the related processing are managed by the underlying software stack, transparently to Qt and the application. An example of such headsets are some devices from Varjo, or the non-standalone devices in the HTC Vive range.</p>
<p>Some devices fall into both categories. Most notably, the Meta Quest 3 supports both modes of operation.</p>
<p>With standalone devices, all rendering and processing happens on the headset itself. There is a single implementation of OpenXR and the underlying runtime environment, which applications then use when launched on the device.</p>
<p>With non-standalone devices, all rendering and most of the related processing happens on the host PC. The quality and performance depend heavily on the host PC's capabilities, but the streaming technology and associated factors, such as the wireless network bandwidth, can affect the results as well. In the PCVR world, there are multiple solutions that provide an OpenXR implementation and wired or wireless streaming.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>Due to OpenXR being an open standard, devices that are compatible with it may work, even if the devices were not tested and verified by Qt. This means that full functionality and compatibility cannot be guaranteed out of the box.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="devices-and-platforms-not-based-on-openxr">Devices and platforms not based on OpenXR</h3>
<p>Qt Quick 3D Xr currently supports one non-OpenXR platform: Apple's visionOS. Devices such as the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> fall into the <code translate="no">Standalone VR</code> category.</p>
<h2 id="tested-and-verified-headsets-tier-one">Tested and Verified Headsets, Tier One</h2>
<p>This is the list of devices that are regularly tested and verified by Qt and are actively used during the development of Qt Quick 3D Xr. <span id="visionos-supported-versions"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Meta Quest 3, standalone (Android)</li>
<li>Meta Quest 3, PCVR mode (Windows)</li>
<li>Apple Vision Pro, standalone (visionOS)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tested-and-verified-headsets-tier-two">Tested and Verified Headsets, Tier Two</h2>
<p>This is a list of additional devices that are tested occasionally during Qt Quick 3D Xr development, and can be expected to work, but full functionality cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta Quest 2, standalone (Android)</li>
<li>HTC Vive in PCVR mode (Linux)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="special-developer-environments">Special Developer Environments</h2>
<p>This is a list of VR simulator solutions that are used during Qt Quick 3D Xr development and can be useful for application developers as well. Full functionality is not guaranteed with these solutions, especially when it comes to AR features.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/xrsim-intro/">Meta XR Simulator</a> (Windows). This is an OpenXR implementation for Windows that shows the rendered content separately for the left and eye right in a desktop window while offering input controller simulation and many other developer-oriented features. From the applications' perspective, using the simulator is no different from PCVR on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, other devices using OpenXR, for example, the Pico 4, may be functional too, but this is not verified by Qt. The list of tested devices can be expected to change and increase in future Qt releases.</p>
<p>When it comes to PCVR, there are further software stack details and complications that may need to be considered. See the dedicated <a href="qt3dxr-pcvr.html">PCVR</a> page for details.</p>
<p>Qt Quick 3D Xr prints warnings on the debug output by default. Diagnostic messages are not printed out of the box. To enable those, enable the <code translate="no">qt.quick3d.xr</code> logging category. For example, by setting the environment variable <code translate="no">QT_LOGGING_RULES=qt.quick3d.xr=true</code>. See <a href="../qtcore/qloggingcategory.html" translate="no">QLoggingCategory</a> for more information. It is strongly recommended that the additional debug prints are enabled, whenever problems arise, or if the application does not start as expected. When reporting problems, always include the full log in the error report. Due to the vast variety of ways to run an XR application, especially when OpenXR is involved, these logs are essential in order to better understand what is happening.</p>
