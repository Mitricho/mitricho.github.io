 PCRE2 License
 =============

 | SPDX-License-Identifier: | BSD-3-Clause WITH PCRE2-exception |
 |---------|-------|

 PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

 Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the &quot;BSD&quot;
 licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
 redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the &quot;doc&quot; directory,
 is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
 testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

 The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
 included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
 optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
 the library is built.

 Many other contributors have participated in the authorship of PCRE2. As PCRE2

 assignment agreement, all contributions have copyright retained by each

 EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
 ------------------------------------------

 The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
 not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
 PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
 includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
 PCRE2 independently.
